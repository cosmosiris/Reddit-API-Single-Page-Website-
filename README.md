### About
I made this single page website because I was practicing my API and JSON parsing skills and Reddit API calls were a good way to get started. I thought to myself, "there's so many contrasting communities on Reddit. I've never really used Reddit but I wonder what the Black Lives Matter page looks like?" I checked it out and then wondered what a White Lives Matter page looks like. I ultimately ended up using the Reddit Black Lives Matter Page and the Reddit White Rights Page to make a single page website that places the feeds of both pages side by side. The title of each post is inside of a box and if you click on the title of a post you will be directed to the corresponding Reddit comments page. 

It may not be exactly clear in the beginning which side is which. It's up to the user to figure it out! 

The website is not yet live because I haven't determined what domain I want to purchase for it. In the meantime you can checkout some pictures!
