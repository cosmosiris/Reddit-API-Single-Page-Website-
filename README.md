### Purpose
I made this single page website because I was practicing my API and JSON parsing skills through a web tutorial and one of our assignments had us make a Reddit API call. I thought to myself, there's so many contrasting communities on Reddit. I've never really used Reddit but I wonder what the Black Lives Matter page looks like? I checked it out and then wondered what a White Lives Matter page looks like. I ultimately ended up using the Reddit Black Lives Matter Page and the Reddit White Rights Page to make a single page website. This website places the feeds of both pages side by side by placing the title of each post inside of a box. If you click on the title of a post you will be directed to the corresponding Reddit comments page. 

Initially I was going to have an image display whenever a visitor hovers over a post. But, many of the posts did not have images so I scrapped that idea and decided to turn each post into a link. 

I haven't determined what domain I want to purchase for this page, so in the meantime you can checkout some pictures!
